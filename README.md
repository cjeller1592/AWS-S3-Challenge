# AWS S3 Challenge

This is a response to the S3 challenge in the Udemy course [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate: SAA-C02 exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-associate-pass-the-saa-c02-exam/).

The challenge requires that you create a bucket with a particular lifecycle policy, two folders, and one file in a particular folder. 

I've tackled the challenge with one solution that uses a script that implements the AWS CLI and another that uses Terraform.
